<p>I consider myself inherently introverted,
as I have always been naturally introverted in social situations.
Sometimes, I can be clumsy in socializing,
which makes me feel paranoid about being ridiculed, embarrassed, or even ignored by others.
This anxiety often leads me to conceal my true emotions,

<p>Lately, I’ve been feeling stressed and anxious,
often drained and exhausted from the demands of daily life.
I tend to feel worn out and overwhelmed by my responsibilities,
which is why I seek out activities that can provide a marvelous form of recreation.
Engaging in a great pastime, like painting or hiking,
can spice up my routine and serve as a great form of amusement.
These activities are therapeutic and refreshing,

When I totally immerse myself in these hobbies,
I become engrossed in the moment and can leave those worries behind.
They help me escape from my stressful routine,
allowing me to unwind properly and recharge my batteries.
Creating a pleasant ambience or agreeable atmosphere during these activities helps me find inner peace and spiritual harmony,
filling the void inside me and providing a much-needed break from the hustle and bustle of city life. It’s essential for me to get away from my work for a spell and enjoy these moments of tranquility.

<p>While I have no aversion to trying new things,
some subjects just hold little appeal to me.
For instance, topics that are often considered inaccessible or obscure can feel quite elusive and complicated.
I find that they often present impenetrable concepts that blur the distinction between what I can grasp and what remains confusing.
Consequently, it would be really demanding for me to learn more about them,
as my interest simply isn&rsquo;t there.
Instead, I prefer to engage in other activities that resonate more with my personal preferences, allowing me to enjoy my time and invest my energy in pursuits that truly excite me.

I make a conscious effort to devote myself to my work.
I don’t want to be disturbed by distractions, as I know I can’t operate well when distracted.
To achieve this, I often isolate myself from noise and interruptions,
creating an environment that fosters focus.
When I’m focused,
I become completely immersed in my tasks and can be unaware of the passage of time.
This deep concentration helps me guarantee my efficiency and productivity,
