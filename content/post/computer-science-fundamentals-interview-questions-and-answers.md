# Computer Science Fundamentals Interview Questions and Answers

## Computer Networks

### 1. What is the OSI model?

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. The OSI model characterizes computing functions into seven layers:

1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer

### 2. Explain the difference between TCP and UDP.

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
  - Connection-oriented
  - Reliable, ensures all data is received
  - Flow control and congestion control
  - Slower than UDP
  - Used for applications requiring high reliability (e.g., file transfer, email)

- UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
  - Connectionless
  - Unreliable, doesn't guarantee data delivery
  - No flow control or congestion control
  - Faster than TCP
  - Used for applications that prioritize speed (e.g., video streaming, online gaming)

### 3. What is DNS and how does it work?

DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses.

Process:
1. User enters a URL in the browser
2. Browser checks its cache for DNS record
3. If not found, it queries the OS
4. If still not found, it contacts a DNS resolver
5. The resolver queries root servers, then TLD servers, then authoritative name servers
6. The IP address is returned to the browser

### 4. What is a subnet and subnet mask?

A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address, and divides the IP address into network address and host address.

Subnetting allows for more efficient use of IP addresses and improved network performance.

### 5. Explain the concept of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).

ARP is a protocol used to map an IP address to a physical machine address (MAC address) in a local network. 

Process:
1. Device wants to send a packet to an IP address
2. It checks its ARP cache for the corresponding MAC address
3. If not found, it broadcasts an ARP request
4. The device with the matching IP address responds with its MAC address
5. The sender updates its ARP cache and sends the packet

### 6. What is the difference between a hub, switch, and router?

- Hub: Layer 1 device, broadcasts data to all ports
- Switch: Layer 2 device, forwards data to specific port based on MAC address
- Router: Layer 3 device, forwards data between different networks based on IP address

### 7. Explain the three-way handshake in TCP.

The three-way handshake is used to establish a TCP connection:

1. SYN: Client sends a SYN packet to the server
2. SYN-ACK: Server responds with a SYN-ACK packet
3. ACK: Client sends an ACK packet to the server

After these steps, the connection is established and data transfer can begin.

### 8. What is DHCP and what is it used for?

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol used to dynamically assign an IP address to any device, or node, on a network so it can communicate using IP.

DHCP automates and centrally manages these configurations rather than requiring network administrators to manually assign IP addresses to all network devices.

### 9. Explain the difference between IPv4 and IPv6.

- IPv4:
  - 32-bit address
  - Supports up to ~4.3 billion unique addresses
  - Uses dot-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1)

- IPv6:
  - 128-bit address
  - Supports a vastly larger address space
  - Uses hexadecimal notation with colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

### 10. What is NAT and why is it used?

NAT (Network Address Translation) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.

NAT is primarily used to:
- Conserve IPv4 addresses
- Improve security by hiding internal network addresses

## Operating Systems

### 11. What is an operating system?

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user.

### 12. Explain the difference between a process and a thread.

- Process:
  - Independent execution unit
  - Has its own memory space
  - Heavyweight, more resources
  - Isolated from other processes

- Thread:
  - Lightweight unit of execution within a process
  - Shares memory space with other threads in the same process
  - Less resource-intensive
  - Can communicate easily with other threads in the same process

### 13. What is virtual memory?

Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine" which "creates the illusion to users of a very large (main) memory."

It allows a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage.

### 14. Explain the concept of deadlock and its four necessary conditions.

Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting to acquire a resource held by another process.

Four necessary conditions (Coffman conditions):
1. Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode
2. Hold and Wait: A process must be holding at least one resource while waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes
3. No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process; they must be released voluntarily
4. Circular Wait: A circular chain of two or more processes, each waiting for a resource held by the next member in the chain

### 15. What is the purpose of paging in an operating system?

Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. It allows the physical address space of a process to be non-contiguous.

Benefits:
- Efficient use of memory
- Supports virtual memory
- Simplifies memory allocation

### 16. Explain the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.

- Preemptive Scheduling:
  - The CPU can be taken away from a process before it finishes its burst time
  - Better for time-sharing systems
  - Can lead to race conditions if not properly managed

- Non-preemptive Scheduling:
  - Once the CPU has been allocated to a process, the process keeps it until it releases the CPU either by terminating or by switching to the waiting state
  - Simpler to implement
  - Can lead to poor response time for interactive processes

### 17. What is a system call?

A system call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system. System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system.

Examples of system calls:
- File operations (open, read, write, close)
- Process control (fork, exec, exit)
- Device management
- Information maintenance
- Communication

### 18. Explain the concept of thrashing.

Thrashing is a condition where excessive paging operations are taking place. It occurs when a computer's virtual memory subsystem is in a constant state of paging, rapidly exchanging data in memory for data on disk, to the exclusion of most application-level processing.

Causes:
- Insufficient physical memory
- Poor page replacement algorithms
- Large working sets

### 19. What is the purpose of a semaphore?

A semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent system. It's used for process synchronization and to solve critical section problems.

Types:
- Binary Semaphore (mutex): Can have only 0 or 1 as value
- Counting Semaphore: Can have any non-negative value

### 20. Explain the concept of fragmentation in memory management.

Fragmentation is a phenomenon in which storage space is used inefficiently, reducing capacity or performance and often both.

Types:
- Internal Fragmentation: Occurs when more memory is allocated than is needed
- External Fragmentation: Occurs when free memory is broken into small blocks, making it hard to allocate large contiguous chunks

## Data Structures

### 21. What is the difference between an array and a linked list?

- Array:
  - Fixed size (in most languages)
  - Contiguous memory allocation
  - Fast random access
  - Insertion/deletion is expensive (except at the end)

- Linked List:
  - Dynamic size
  - Non-contiguous memory allocation
  - Slow random access
  - Fast insertion/deletion

### 22. Explain the difference between a stack and a queue.

- Stack:
  - Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure
  - Push (insert) and pop (remove) operations occur at the same end
  - Used for function calls, undo mechanisms, expression evaluation

- Queue:
  - First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure
  - Enqueue (insert) at rear, dequeue (remove) from front
  - Used for task scheduling, breadth-first search

### 23. What is a binary search tree?

A binary search tree is a binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. For each node:
- All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value
- All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value

This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

### 24. Explain the concept of hashing and hash tables.

Hashing is a technique used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. It involves using a hash function to map keys to indices of an array (hash table).

Hash Table:
- Data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type
- Uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots

Collision Resolution:
- Chaining: Each bucket is independent, and has some sort of list of entries with the same index
- Open Addressing: All entry records are stored in the bucket array itself

### 25. What is a balanced tree and why is it important?

A balanced tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than one. Examples include AVL trees and Red-Black trees.

Importance:
- Ensures O(log n) time complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and search
- Prevents degeneration into a linked list, which would result in O(n) time complexity

### 26. Explain the difference between DFS and BFS.

- Depth-First Search (DFS):
  - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
  - Uses a stack (or recursion)
  - Memory efficient for trees
  - Can get trapped in infinite loops for graphs

- Breadth-First Search (BFS):
  - Explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving to nodes at the next depth level
  - Uses a queue
  - Finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs
  - Can be memory-intensive

### 27. What is a heap data structure?

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property:
- In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key of P is greater than or equal to the key of C
- In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C

Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues and in sorting algorithms like heapsort.

### 28. Explain the concept of dynamic programming.

Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. It works by breaking down a complex problem into simpler subproblems in a recursive manner.

Characteristics:
- Overlapping Subproblems
- Optimal Substructure

Common examples:
- Fibonacci sequence
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Knapsack problem

### 29. What is a trie and what is it used for?

A trie, also called digital tree or prefix tree, is a kind of search tree—an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.

Uses:
- Autocomplete
- Spell checkers
- IP routing tables
- Solving word games

### 30. Explain the concept of a self-balancing tree.

A self-balancing tree is a type of binary search tree that automatically keeps its height small in the face of arbitrary insertions and deletions. This ensures that operations like search, insert, and delete take O(log n) time.

Examples:
- AVL trees
- Red-Black trees
- Splay trees

These trees use rotations to maintain balance after insertions and deletions.

### 31. What is the time complexity of common operations in different data structures?

- Array:
  - Access: O(1)
  - Search: O(n)
  - Insertion: O(n)
  - Deletion: O(n)

- Linked List:
  - Access: O(n)
  - Search: O(n)
  - Insertion: O(1)
  - Deletion: O(1)

- Binary Search Tree (balanced):
  - Search: O(log n)
  - Insertion: O(log n)
  - Deletion: O(log n)

- Hash Table:
  - Search: O(1) average, O(n) worst
  - Insertion: O(1) average, O(n) worst
  - Deletion: O(1) average, O(n) worst

### 32. Explain the concept of a graph and its representations.

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

Representations:
- Adjacency Matrix: 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices
- Adjacency List: Array of linked lists
- Edge List: List of all edges in the graph

### 33. What is the difference between a min-heap and a max-heap?

- Min-Heap:
  - The root node has the minimum value
  - For any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C

- Max-Heap:
  - The root node has the maximum value
  - For any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key of P is greater than or equal to the key of C

Both are commonly used to implement priority queues.

### 34. Explain the concept of a B-tree.

A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. It is optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.

Properties:
- All leaves are at the same level
- A non-leaf node with k children contains k-1 keys
- Each node (except root) must contain at least t-1 keys, where t is the minimum degree of B-tree
- All nodes may contain at most 2t-1 keys

B-trees are commonly used in databases and file systems.

### 35. What is a skip list?

A skip list is a probabilistic data structure that allows O(log n) search complexity as well as O(log n) insertion complexity within an ordered sequence of elements. It is created from a linked list by adding multiple layers of header nodes.

Advantages:
- Performs as well as balanced trees
- Simpler to implement than balanced tree structures

### 36. Explain the difference between internal and external sorting.

- Internal Sorting:
  - All data to be sorted is held in main memory
  - Faster but limited by available RAM
  - Examples: Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort

- External Sorting:
  - Used when data doesn't fit into main memory and must reside in slower external memory (like a hard drive)
  - Involves multiple steps, often using merge sort
  - Example: External merge sort

### 37. What is a bloom filter?

A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set. It can tell us, rapidly and memory-efficiently, whether an element is present in a set.

Properties:
- Can have false positives, but no false negatives
- Space efficient, but cannot remove elements

Uses:
- Caching
- Detecting malicious URLs
- Spell checking

### 38. Explain the concept of a disjoint-set data structure.

A disjoint-set data structure, also called a union-find data structure, keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.

Operations:
- Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in
- Union: Join two subsets into a single subset

Uses:
- Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees
- Detecting cycles in graphs

### 39. What is the difference between comparison-based and non-comparison-based sorting algorithms?

- Comparison-based Sorting:
  - Use comparisons between elements to determine the order
  - Examples: Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort
  - Lower bound of O(n log n) for worst and average case

- Non-comparison-based Sorting:
  - Don't use comparisons between elements
  - Examples: Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort
  - Can achieve O(n) time complexity under certain conditions

### 40. Explain the concept of amortized analysis in data structures.

Amortized analysis is a method for analyzing a sequence of operations to show that the average cost per operation is small, even though a single operation within the sequence might be expensive.

It's particularly useful for data structures where occasional operations trigger a costly reorganization, but the cost of that reorganization can be "amortized" over many operations.

Example: Dynamic Array (like ArrayList in Java or vector in C++)
- Most append operations are O(1)
- Occasional resizing operations are O(n)
- Amortized time for append is still O(1)
